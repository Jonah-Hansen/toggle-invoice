### to get started, please run
## `pip install -r requirements.txt -t ./venv`

### rename `preference.example.json` to `preference.json` and populate with your info.

running 
### `python main.py`
will generate a pdf inside /generated_pdfs for the most recent pay day as defined in preferences > options > payDays
- pdf will include the hours from projects in your workspace, rounded to preferences > options > roundingMinutes

## For ease of use, I recommend creating shortcuts to main.py, and /generated_invoices and place on your desktop
